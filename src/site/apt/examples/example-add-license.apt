Add a license not present in license-maven-plugin

  You might want to add a new license that is not already managed by the plugin
  (common free software licenses are managed, but in case of proprietary
  software (open or closed source, other license might be used).

* Create the license files

  To use a new license, you need to define two content files :

  - the header file (this content will be added in header of all source files)
  - the license file (this file is the real license file placed at the root of the maven project in
    (by convention) LICENSE.txt file.

  * src/license/my_license/header.txt

    Example for GPLv3 :

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public

<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html>.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * src/license/my_license/license.txt

  Example for GPLv3 :

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

...

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Declare the new license

  The new license(s) must be declared in the file :
  src/license/licenses.properties. One license per line like :

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    my_license=My license
    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The default (convention) configuration use <<header.txt>> and <<license.txt>> as file names for the header and license file.

  This can be changed using this syntax in the license repository definition file like this

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    my_license=My license~~license:licenseFileName.html~~header:headerFileName.html

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In this example, you have then to define a <<licenseFileName.html>> and <<headerFileName.html>> file in the
  <<my_license>> directory.


* Configure the plugin

  You need to specify the name of your license and where to find it.
